			<h3>About</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Vashco Goshen is a professional photographer who has been in the industry for a period spanning close to two decades. He has also won awards as the best photographer twice already in Zimbabwe, and an international award by the Natural Geographic in 2018. Recently I have developed in interest in wildlife, nature and urbanization photography, with the objective of showcasing the impact of man on the environment i.e, the fauna and the flora. Currently, I am with the Afica Conserve Initiative, where I am working as the Director of Photography for a documentary which will soon be aired on Zoo Television Channel.</p>
